Joda-Time version 1.2.1
-----------------------

Joda-Time is a date and time handling library that seeks to replace the JDK
Date and Calendar classes.

This is a patch release for Joda-Time 1.2.
This release only contains bug fixes.
We recommend all users of 1.2 upgrade to 1.2.1.

We recommend JDK 1.3 or later, and have performed no testing on earlier JDKs.

Joda-Time is licensed under the business-friendly Apache License Version 2.
This is the same license as all of Apache, plus other open source projects such as Spring.
The intent is to make the code available to the Java community with the minimum
of restrictions. If the license causes you problems please contact the mailing list.

Bug fixes since 1.2
-------------------
- DateTime/DateMidnight/MutableDateTime/AbstractInstant
   Conversion methods toDateTime, toDateTimeISO, toMutableDateTime, and
    toMutableDateTimeISO now preserve the time zone.
    Previously calling any of these four methods would convert the result to
    the default time zone. This was incorrect.
    The methods have been changed to preserve the time zone.
   The similarly named methods on Instant have not changed behaviour.

- DateTimeFormatterBuilder.MatchingParser
   Previously didn't estimate parsed length correctly


Enhancements since 1.2
